PSUEDO CODE WAY TAKING UP WAY TOO MUCH SPACE ON MY JS FILE


//first thing to do is create variables that locate all of the boxes
	// just do them one by one for now then try to shorten with iteration later(

//i need to randomize all the divs that make up the game board upon page load! that way I can assign event listeners to the numbered squares and images for each square that can remain the same. ie box one is always the color blue when you flip it, but it is in a different place everytime the game loads

//anna suggested making all of my divs in my javascript function

// im pretty sure that like in the tic tac toe excersize, I will need to set a variable to zero then use ++ to make sure that the turn counter goes up by one each time

//I need a function returns an event
	//the function needs to have an event listener that flips the card when clicked
	//once clicked, a class needs to be added(maybe)
	//then matching classes remain up, and non matching classes flip back

	//only two cards can be up at a time


	//1. give class to a card once it is clicked that corresponds to an image in the css. Will that class stay if I click it again? 


	//when all cards are flipped up, let the user know that they won
