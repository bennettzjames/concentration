-user stories
	-USER SHOULD BE ABLE TO:
		-See a grid of boxes(4x4 at a minimum)
		-Each box in the grid should be seperate but identical when the page loads
		-a button should be added that shows the rules of the game when pressed
		-When the user presses a box, it should flip(perhaps with animation)
		-when the box is flipped, it should reveal a simple image
		-the user will have one chance to attempt to locate the matching image
		-IF the two images match, those two should remain on the page
		-HOWEVER if they do not match, they must flip back over
		-once all of the matching images have been revealed the user should be alerted that they one the game
		-There should be a reset button to play again
		-Reset button should only be visible while game is in play
		-reset button needs to be arrange images in random order when reset
		-(optional) it would be cool if there was a timer that would track the time it takes the user to win the game
		-(optional) it would also be cool to track the best times of the user.
